# AS7

This directory holds an Atmel Studio 7 Solution and Project with all the firmware files.

All files except for `sketch.cpp` are included as links to the arduino directories, so any updates you make in AS7 will be reflected in the arduino structure.

The `skecth.cpp` file is a stub of an arduino-style sketch. You can write code where and then copy everything except the `#include "Arduino.h" into an arduino sketch.

I much prefer working in AS7 to the Arduino IDE so it was worth the effort to make this.
