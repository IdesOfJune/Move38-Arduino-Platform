### Blinks Core Files

All `.h` files are for internal consumption except for `Arduino.h` which is automatically included in all Arduino sketches and defines the API of user callable functions.  

`WMath.cpp` is taken from the Arduino core. It provides wrappers for some `random()` functions from `stdlib` and the `map()` function.
