/*

    This library presents an API for game developers on the Move38 Blinks platform.
    More info at http://Move38.com
    
    This API sits on top of the hardware abstraction layer and presents a simplified representation
    of the current state of the tile and its adjacent neighbors. 
    
    It handles all the low level protocol to communicate state with neighbors, and
    offers high level functions for setting the color and detecting button interactions.
